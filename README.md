# FRC-PracticeProject-2021 (Formerly Practice-Project)
Updating 2020 semi-outdated command-based code to the latest 2021 command-based framework, while adding new features.

## Postseason / pre-archival comment
This code was based off of the [2020 robot's code](https://github.com/frc6506/FRC-RobotCode-2020) and devloped during the 2021 season (COIVD-19 pandemic).
From the readme:

>This is the repostiory for the 2020 FRC season- Infinte Recharge. This code was delvoped by FRC Team #6505, Steel Boot Robotics. Visit https://steelboot.weebly.com/contact-us.html if you would like to inquire about it (we really should fill out the license file, although most FIRST projects use the FIRST BSD license (BSD 3 clause)).

>Development for the 2021 season (a countiation of 2020) has been moved to https://github.com/frc6506/Practice-Project (It really should be renamed) and https://github.com/frc6506/FRC-Robot-Characterization-2021 . Any remaining bugs will not be fixed here.

At the time this repostry was created, WPLib-j had undegone a rather extensive update, so the commandbased code used relied on a deprecated library version.
